# AI-Powered Stock Price Predictor

An AI-powered stock price predictor that provides real-time stock tracking, predicted vs. actual price visualization, user authentication, and portfolio tracking. The project uses React.js (frontend) and Node.js with Express.js (backend), with a machine learning model (LSTM or ARIMA) to predict stock prices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Stock Tracking:** Track stock prices in real-time.
- **Predicted vs. Actual Price Visualization:** Compare predicted prices with actual stock data using charts.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and signup system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Users can save their favorite stocks and track their portfolio.
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Predict future stock prices using LSTM or ARIMA model.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**
- **Recharts** (for stock price charts)
- **Axios** (for API calls)
- **React Router DOM** (for routing)

### Backend

- **Node.js with Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (for storing user data and historical stock prices)
- **BcryptJS** (for password hashing)
- **JWT** (for authentication)
- **Axios** (for communication between frontend and backend)

### Machine Learning

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** or **ARIMA** for stock price prediction
